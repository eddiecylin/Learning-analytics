This study, through the examination of longitudinal K-12 teacher assigned grading histories for entire cohorts of students from a school district (n=188), demonstrates a novel application of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization in which all data points collected on every student in a cohort can be patterned, visualized and interpreted to aid in data driven decision making by teachers and administrators. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method. Hierarchical cluster analysis correctly identified over 80% of the students who dropped out using the entire student grade history patterns from either K-12 or K-8.

Understanding how learning relationships form in undergraduate classrooms, as well as the impacts these relationships have on learning outcomes, can inform educators in unique ways and improve educational reform. Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies. Our aims are to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analyses to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so, in the process inspiring future educational studies incorporating relational data.","2014-06-20","2017-09-12 14:45:23","2017-09-12 14:45:23","2014-08-20 20:21:46","167-178","","2","13","","CBE Life Sci Educ","Understanding Classrooms through Social Network Analysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.lifescied.org","","","","","http://www.lifescied.org/content/13/2/167","Week 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We still face the core question - Who should own the data? Traditional standard teaching practice assumes at least average skills across the board. However, it failed to take the individual differences into consideration.</li> <li>For a group of people, statistics patterns might have some implications on adjustment in policies, design of teach activities. Sometimes those general implications try to satisfy most people, but actually they fit nobody. The aggregate statistics means nothing towards an individual. However, if we start from an individual pattern perspective (like IRT, CDM), it could provide more insights towards each individual. </li> <li>I agree that personality and learning varies across contexts. That’s why when we make attribution or interpretation through data, we need to be very careful about the assumptions and limitation that we might have.</li> <li>This article also raises a very interesting question - what is your value proposition of 4-year education, considering the trend of MOOCs. Some people might think it is the climate of the school, also the network or soft resources in school. From my perspective, these face-to-face things still can be done through the internet as long as we have proper platform and regulation, have something to support from a system perspective. At the end of the day, the question should be answered by individual differences - who am I? what kind of study suits me better? what do I want to be in the future? That’s why even from learning perspective, educational data should contain individual patterns, and it should be owned by students, to stimulate their awareness, ownership, engagement towards their life. The interviewee did understand this phenomena from a  relative objective perspective - business model, and he did not anti-company as well. Instead, he thinks that market needs an innovative solution in order to become a functional market.</li> <li>I am surprised to see that the interviewee also pointed out the phenomena - everyone is trying to innovate in their platform, and there is lack of interoperability standards or formate standards from a long-term sustainable development perspective. This is “a lack of appreciation that data is the thing”.</li> </ul>","","http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/why-students-should-own-their-educational-data/54329","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.","1994-12-01","2017-09-12 14:45:24","2017-09-12 14:45:24","2013-04-21 21:21:19","253-278","","4","4","","User Model User-Adap Inter","Knowledge tracing","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu","","","","","","","Education (general); empirical validity; individual differences; intelligent tutoring systems; Learning; Management of Computing and Information Systems; mastery learning; Multimedia Information Systems; procedural knowledge; Psychology, general; student modeling; User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human meaning-making plays an important role to support the learning analytics process.</span></li> <li><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">In fact, I am deeply impressed by the good case practice of human Data Wranglers at the Open University, UK, because of the systematic approach they are adopting in the organization. No matter for which organization in education area, the trend of data is a huge change that impact on nearly everyone. From an organization psychology perspective, how to manage the change from a systematic approach is very important, and it can influence the actual results. That’s why I appreciate the organization practice of Open University, like ""academic staff/faculty and researchers need to be supported to learn to interpret and design learning analytics”, “establishment of a contextual framework”, “developing a culture of data use as part of increasing organizational capacity”. I am also excited to see that data wranglers “building up relationships with key stakeholders toenable the reports to focus on areas where they can be of most value” and “seek opportunities to engage withFaculty academics”. By doing this, every stakeholder can have proper communication with each other, and can “steer the agenda towards richer conceptions of learning than a naive quantitative view”, to make sure synergy can happen between learning analytics and learning design. I appreciate this systematic approach. Just like what it mentioned at the end of the paper: “present data 'to those involved in strategic institutional planning in ways that have the power to motivate organizational adoption and cultural change’”. I feel strongly inspired by this as a social-organizational psychology student.</span></li> <li><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">They also utilize a human resource development approach to build learning analytics capacity as part of a Community of Practice, breaking the general assumption that the role of data wrangler is only to analyze the data. Additionally, all data is available to academics directly, which can stimulate their autonomy to a larger degree. The article makes it clear by presenting three scenarios clearly and concisely in the pictures.</span></li> <li><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">Meanwhile, we also have to admit that this is a high cost approach in terms of time. </span></li> <li style=""list-style: none;""> <ul> <li><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">Now it is an institution-wide top-down analytics strategy in place, and this is built on a bottom-up understanding of at least some of the potential of the data to improve learning. </span></li> <li><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">A bottom-up, grounded approach is necessary for sense making.

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2017-09-12 14:45:28","2017-09-12 14:45:28","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<ul> <li><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">Thanks to this generic framework, I have a general understanding towards learning analytics. The framework contains both technically-focused research questions and softer issues and problem areas. There are six critical dimensions of LA, including stakeholders, objectives, data, instruments, external constrains, internal limitation. It is very impressive that the generic framework also includes soft issues - challenges that depend on assumptions being made about humans or the society in general.</span></li> <li><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">The framework can be used as a checklist when designing a purposeful LA process; or as a sharable description framework to compare context parameters with other similar approaches in other contexts. I agree that the framework is more like “both a descriptive approach as well as a guide to the design process of LA applications”, and that “development should not happen without a guiding framework that combines use of educational data with theprotection of individuals and their learning.”. Personally for me, this is more like a standardized process and materials, and it is qualitative instead of quantitative. We are not sure how the inherent connections among the six dimensions are connected. The general preference of this article is more soft issues focused, and less technically-focused.</span></li> <li><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">I am most impressed by the assumption of this framework - “responsible designers of analytic processes will not only implement what is technically possible to do and legally allowed (or at least not prohibited), but to</span> <span style=""background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"">consider holistically the outcomes for stakeholders and, even more importantly, the consequences for the data subjects.</span><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">”</span></li> <li><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">Other insights that I’ve got are</span></li> <li style=""list-style: none;""> <ul> <li><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">I never thought of this perspective until seeing this article - ""by comparison, still seem somewhat bizarre that in the commercial worldwith clicking the “register” button, the default access to all user data becomes owned by some company, whereas educational institutions operate on the default that everything is protected from virtually everyone.”</span></li> <li><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">“Using statistical analytic findings is a quantitative not a qualitative support agent to such decision making.” “aligning and regulating performance and behaviour of individual teachers or learners against a statisticalnorm without investigating the reasons for their divergence may strongly stifle innovation, individuality, creativityand experimentation""</span></li> <li><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">“From a technical point of view, idealised datasets probably remain the biggest challenge for analytics” “users ‘pollute' databases by producing erroneous or incomplete datasets.""</span></li> <li><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">“High drop-out rates are a challenging problem in education, especially distance education.""</span></li> <li><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">“Competing methods, technologies and algorithms applied to the same set of data, will result in different outcomes, and thus may lead to different consequences in terms of decision making based on these outcomes.""</span></li> <li><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">""The fundamental question legislators need to ask is: who does a person’s lifedata belong to?"" ""the extent of a student’s data contract with an institution and its individual staff representatives indifferent roles (teacher, administrator, secretary, researcher, IT support staff, Deans and management, etc.) needs to be urgently clarified.""</span></li> </ul> </li> <li><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: 14px;"">“data economy” is a current trend and it made colle</span><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">cting data an affordable activity, and it can reflect real and un interrupted user behavior.</span></li> </ul>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It requires a thorough understanding of the subject matter and of the cognitive factors that determine student performance. The skills definition, and the mapping of item to skills, require the involvement of experts. We investigate means to assist experts for this task by using a data driven, matrix factorization approach. The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on one side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise. The prediction comparison shows the factorization approach performs slightly better than the original expert Q-matrix, giving supporting evidence to the belief that the factorization mapping is valid. Implications for the use of the factorization to design better item to skills mapping are discussed.","2013-07-09","2017-09-12 14:45:28","2017-09-12 14:45:28","2016-09-03 20:44:11","441-450","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","en","©2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","","","","link.springer.com","","","","","https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","","User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction; Artificial Intelligence (incl.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.","2008-04","2017-09-12 14:45:29","2017-09-12 14:45:29","2016-09-04 01:23:19","","","","","","","","","","","","EUROSIS","Porto, Spain","eng","openAccess","","","","repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt","","","","","http://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/8024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5th Annual Future Business Technology Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
