This study, through the examination of longitudinal K-12 teacher assigned grading histories for entire cohorts of students from a school district (n=188), demonstrates a novel application of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization in which all data points collected on every student in a cohort can be patterned, visualized and interpreted to aid in data driven decision making by teachers and administrators. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method. Hierarchical cluster analysis correctly identified over 80% of the students who dropped out using the entire student grade history patterns from either K-12 or K-8.

Understanding how learning relationships form in undergraduate classrooms, as well as the impacts these relationships have on learning outcomes, can inform educators in unique ways and improve educational reform. Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies. Our aims are to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analyses to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so, in the process inspiring future educational studies incorporating relational data.","2014-06-20","2017-09-27 06:50:29","2017-09-27 06:50:29","2014-08-20 20:21:46","167-178","","2","13","","CBE Life Sci Educ","Understanding Classrooms through Social Network Analysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.lifescied.org","","","<p>Network Types:</p> <p>Unipartite: consist of only one type of actor</p> <p>Bipartite: two mode</p> <p>Directional: one way or two way</p> <p>Egocentric studies focus on a sample of individuals (called “egos”) and the local social environment surrounding them without explicitly attempting to “connect the dots” in the network further.</p> <p>census networks, sometimes referred to as whole networks, collect data from an entire bounded population of actors, including identifiable information about the respondents’ relational partners.

Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.","1994-12-01","2017-09-27 06:50:30","2017-09-27 06:50:30","2013-04-21 21:21:19","253-278","","4","4","","User Model User-Adap Inter","Knowledge tracing","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu","","","<p>Examines the use of a programming tutor and its effectiveness on student learning in a self-paced environment</p> <p>Only an abstract and short stub   </p>","","","","Learning; Education (general); empirical validity; individual differences; intelligent tutoring systems; Management of Computing and Information Systems; mastery learning; Multimedia Information Systems; procedural knowledge; Psychology, general; student modeling; User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2017-09-27 06:50:31","2017-09-27 06:50:31","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<p>Not much to gain here, as I was only able to see the first page</p> <p>Indicates that it is much easier to get data these days</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods.

As such, it typically comprises the following: de ning a construct; specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive modelling are explored toward the end.","2017","2017-09-27 06:50:32","2017-09-27 06:50:32","","34-48","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<p>operationalization, the repeatability or precision of measurements, sources of error, and the interpretation of the measure itself.</p> <p>Model-based reasoning: accepting a simplified representation of a system that captures salient aspects (e.g., patterns) and allows us to explain or predict phenomena</p> <p>In learning analytics, efficient collection of data is usually not the problem, but the lack of standardization can make it challenging to account for measurement error. </p> <p>A measurement model is a formal mathematical relationship between a latent variable or set of variables and an observable variable or set of variables. </p> <p>learning analytics and educational data mining  explores relationships between psychological scales, behavior, and performance in digital learning environments </p> <p>Factor analysis (Mulaik, 2009) models the correlations among observed variables through a linear relationship to a set of latent variables known as factors. </p> <p>Factor analysis is:Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) - used to determine the number of latent factors from data without strong theoretical assumptions and is commonly part of scale development (note: don’t use EFA with PCA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is a complementary set of techniques to test a theoretically proposed factor model by examining residuals between expected and observed correlations.

In the case of LFA, one or more expert-tagged cognitive models are required initially in order to produce new model discoveries. </p> <p>For a model to be explanatory, one should be able to understand why the model achieves better predictive accuracy than alternatives. In addition, the understanding of this why should either advance our understanding of how learners learn the relevant material or have clear implications for instructional improvements, or both. </p> <p>Explanatory modelling efforts tend to start with “clean” independent variables that have either simple functions or map to clearly defined constructs. For example, LFA derives new variables from existing, expert-labelled variables using simple split, merge, or add operators. </p> <p>Another feature of explanatory models, one that relates most to actionability, is that the dependent variable maps to a well-defined construct. The work on learning rate groups is an example of this: since the groups to which students are classified are defined up front, it is clear what it means for a student to be in the “flat” learning curve group, as opposed to the “steep” one. </p> <p>explanatory models tend to be characterized by fewer estimated parameters (independent variables, or features). For example, the AFM has only one parameter for each student and two parameters for each knowledge component. Adding learning rate groups extends the model by only one additional parameter, group membership. This makes the contribution of the added parameter easy to attribute and interpret. Having fewer parameters also allows each parameter’s estimates to have more explanatory power, alleviating issues of indeterminacy.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
