Understanding how learning relationships form in undergraduate classrooms, as well as the impacts these relationships have on learning outcomes, can inform educators in unique ways and improve educational reform. Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies. Our aims are to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analyses to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so, in the process inspiring future educational studies incorporating relational data.","2014-06-20","2017-09-19 02:55:57","2017-09-19 02:55:57","2014-08-20 20:21:46","167-178","","2","13","","CBE Life Sci Educ","Understanding Classrooms through Social Network Analysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.lifescied.org","","","<p>Key Notes:</p> <p><span style=""font-size: 9.000000pt; font-family: 'Palatino';"">Network analysis can inform our understanding of student network formation in classrooms and the types of impacts these networks have on students.

Every passing day, Genomics and Proteomics yield bucketloads of multivariate data (genes, proteins, DNA, identified peptides, structures), and every one of these biological data units are described by a number of features: length, physicochemical properties, scores, etc. Careful consideration of which features to select when trying to reduce the dimensionality of a specific dataset is, therefore, critical if one wishes to analyze and understand their impact on a model, or to identify what attributes produce a specific biological effect. For instance, considering a predictive model C1A1 + C2A2 + C3A3 … CnAn = S, where Ci are constants, Ai are features or attributes and S is the predictor output (retention time, toxicity, score, etc). It is essential to identify which of those features (A1, A2 and A3…An) are most relevant to the model and to understand how they correlate with S, as working with such a subset will enable the researcher to discard a lot of irrelevant and redundant information. There are two main approaches to this selection process:  Filter approaches: you select the features first, then you use this subset to execute classification or clustering algorithms, etc; Embedded or Wrapper approaches a classification algorithm is applied to the raw dataset in order to identify the most relevant features. One of the simplest and most powerful filter approaches is the use of  correlation matrix filters. In regression and data mining problems, variables may be highly correlated with one another or ""redundant"". For example in cheminformatics, aromatic rings, bond counts and carbon atom counts can be very tightly correlated. If so, any one of these variables could be used as a proxy for all the others. It is best to choose the feature which is most likely to be the direct cause of toxicity, absorption or a specific response distribution.  Correlation Matrix :R Example: Removing features with more than 0.70 of Correlation.import java.util.List;library(corrplot)#corrplot: the library to compute correlation matrix.datMy <- read.table(""data.csv"", header = TRUE)#read the tab file using the read table function.datMy.scale<- scale(datMy[2:ncol(datMy)],center=TRUE,scale=TRUE);#scale all the features (from feature 2 bacause feature 1 is the predictor output)corMatMy <- cor(datMy.scale)#compute the correlation matrixcorrplot(corMatMy, order = ""hclust"")#visualize the matrix, clustering features by correlation index. Resulting Output: Highly Correlate Matrix for 400 features.  After inspecting the matrix, we set the correlation threshold at 0.70.highlyCor <- findCorrelation(corMatMy, 0.70)#Apply correlation filter at 0.70,#then we remove all the variable correlated with more 0.7.datMyFiltered.scale <- datMy.scale[,-highlyCor]corMatMy <- cor(datMyFiltered.scale)corrplot(corMatMy, order = ""hclust"") Resulting Output: Correlation matrix after filter. Now it is possible to filter out “redundant” features by examining in detail the correlation matrix. Remember that the closer the correlation between two variables is to 1, the more related their behavior and the more redundant one is with respect to the other. Using PCA A relatively sophisticated way to do the correlation matrix analysis would be to perform a Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Feature extraction approaches transform data in high-dimensional space to a space of fewer dimensions. Principal component analysis, the most important linear technique for reducing dimensionality, performs a linear mapping of the data to a lower dimensional space in such a way that the variance of the data in the low-dimensional representation is maximized. In other words, PCA analysis builds a set of features by selecting those axes which maximize data variance. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate technique that summarizes systematic patterns of variation in the data. From a data analysis standpoint, PCA is used for studying one table of observations and variables with the idea of transforming the observed variables into a set of new variables, the principal components, which are uncorrelated and explain the variation of the data. Therefore, PCA can be used to bring down a “complex” data set to a lower dimensionality, in order to reveal the structures or the dominant types of variations in both the observations and the variables. PCA in R In R, several functions from a number of different packages can be used to perform PCA. My suggestion is FactoMineR whose typical PCA output consists of a set of eigenvalues, a table with the scores or Principal Components (PCs), and a table of loadings (or correlations between variables and PCs).R Example: PCA function using FactoMineR for 400 features & 5 PCs require(FactoMineR) # PCA with function PCAdatMy <- read.table(""data.csv"", header = TRUE)#read the tab file using the read table function.pca <- PCA(datMy, scale.unit=TRUE, ncp=5, graph=T)#scale all the features,  ncp: number of dimensions kept in the results (by default 5)dimdesc(pca)#This line of code will sort the variables the most linked to each PC. It is very useful when you have many variables. Here, you can find an excellent tutorial on FactoMineR and Principal Component analysis in R: Wrapper Approaches with Backwards Selection""Wrapper"" approaches can be viewed as built-in functions to optimize the number of predictors in the optimization or regression problem.  Many feature selection routines use a ""wrapper"" approach to find appropriate variables such that an algorithm searching through feature space repeatedly fits the model with different predictor sets. The best predictor set is determined by some measure of performance (correlation R^2, root-mean-square deviation). An example of one search routine is backwards selection (a.k.a. recursive feature elimination). In many cases, using these models with built-in feature selection will be more efficient than algorithms where the search routine for the right predictors is external to the model. Built-in feature selection typically couples the predictor search algorithm with parameter estimation, and is usually optimized with a single objective function (e.g. error rates or likelihood). Using Built-in Backward SelectionThe algorithm fits the model to all predictors. Each predictor is ranked according to relevance to the model. With each iteration of feature selection, the Ci top-ranked predictors are retained, the model is refit and performance is re-assessed. Built-in backward selection is being used for at least three purposes: predictor selection, model fitting and performance evaluation. Unless the number of samples is large, especially in relation to the number of variables, one static training set may not be able to fulfill these needs. The ""crantastic"" package caret contains functions for training and plotting classification and regression models. In this case, the rfe function is used to obtain the potential selection. It has several arguments:  x, a matrix or data frame of predictor variables y, a vector (numeric or factor) of outcomes sizes, an integer vector for the specific subset sizes that should be tested (which must not include ncol(x)) rfeControl, a list of options that can be used to specify the model and the methods for prediction, ranking etc.  For a specific model, a set of functions must be specified in rfeControl$functions. There are a number of pre-defined sets of functions for several models, including: linear regression (in the object lmFuncs), random forests (rfFuncs), naive Bayes (nbFuncs), bagged trees (treebagFuncs) and functions that can be used with caret's train function (caretFuncs). R example: Selecting features using backward selection and the caret package library(caret);#load caret librarydata_features<-as.matrix(read.table(""data-features.csv"",sep=""\t"", header=TRUE));#load data featuresdata_class<-as.matrix(read.table('data.csv', header=TRUE));#load data classesdata_features<- scale(data_features, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE);#scale data featuresinTrain <- createDataPartition(data_class, p = 3/4, list = FALSE); #Divide the dataset in train and test sets#Create the Training Dataset for Descriptors trainDescr <- data_features[inTrain,];# Create the Testing dataset for DescriptorstestDescr <- data_features[-inTrain,];trainClass <- data_class[inTrain];testClass <- data_class[-inTrain];descrCorr <- cor(trainDescr);highCorr <- findCorrelation(descrCorr, 0.70);trainDescr <- trainDescr[, -highCorr];testDescr <- testDescr[, -highCorr];# Here, we can included a correlation matrix analysis to remove the redundant features before the backwards selection svmProfile <- rfe(x=trainDescr, y = trainClass, sizes = c(1:5), rfeControl= rfeControl(functions = caretFuncs,number = 2),method = ""svmRadial"",fit = FALSE);#caret function: the rfe is the backwards selection, c is the possible sizes of the features sets, and method the optimization method is a support vector machine.

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders.

The selection of specific data and their weighting (under the methods applied in the “instruments” dimension) against the real behaviour of students is of greatest importance, as is the process of relating behaviour pattern data to cognitive developments.</span>""</p> <p> </p> <p>""<span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">Further research on LA can contribute to decrease</span> <span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">the drop-out rate by developing e.g., a </span><span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-style: italic;"">Drop-out Analyser </span><span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">that notifies the teacher of a course in time which students are in danger of falling behind or dropping out. This could be done by using LMS datasets and train a certain information retrieval technology (e.g., a Bayesian classifier) on the datasets to learn behavioural patterns of students that dropped out.</span>""</p> <p> </p> <p>""<span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">Many different kinds of constraints can limit the beneficial application of LA processes, some being “softer” than others. It has been suggested to us to identify them as ethical, legal, and social constraints, but also to feature organisational, managerial, and process constraints. This we find a useful subdivision of external limitations, but other divisions look equally logical. In the abstraction of the diagram above (cf. Figure 1), we propose the preliminary distinction of </span><span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-style: italic;"">conventions</span><span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">, under which we count ethics, personal privacy, and similar socially motivated limitations, and, </span><span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-style: italic;"">norms </span><span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">that are restricted by laws or specific mandated policies or standards.""</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">""On institutional level, educational and student data was traditionally handled separately, and is legally something of a blind spot. Registration data was kept and maintained by registry staff, IT data by IT staff, and learning data by academic staff. To use LA to its full potential, integration of available institutional datasets needs to happen.</span>""</p> <p> </p> <p>""<span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">Another ethical consideration is the acceptance of divergence in the data constituency (AoIR, 2002). We already touched upon the danger that the result of algorithmic analysis, consequent policies and exercised pressures may aim at uniformity and at mainstreaming learning and teaching processes, thereby greatly harming creative processes and innovation that diverge from the statistical mean.</span>""</p> <p> </p> <p>""<span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">In order to make LA an effective tool for educational practice, it is important to recognise that LA ends with the presentation of algorithmically attained results that require interpretation (Reffay &amp; Chanier, 2003; Mazza &amp; Milani, 2005). There are innumerable ways to present and to interpret data and base consecutive decisions and actions on it, but only some of them will lead to benefits and to improved learning""</span></p> <p><span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">""LA has been effectively used for behaviourist-instructivist style approaches (but see the critical reflection by Pardo &amp; Kloos, 2011), but there is as yet little evidence for the support of constructivist approaches to learning (Duffy &amp; Cunningham, 2001), where learning is seen as an active cognitive process in which learners construct their own concepts of the world around them. In LA, the latter is mostly inferred indirectly, by relating grades of learning outcomes with activities during the learning process (Dawson, 2012). In these correlations, it emerges that active students get better results.</span>""</p> <p> </p> <p>""<span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">In our model, LA can work in support of a multitude of pedagogic strategies and learning activities as manifested and represented by the available data. This means we can only see pedagogies through the data. Because of this, we do not include them as part of the analytics process (Figure 1) but as </span><span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-style: italic;"">implicitly </span><span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">contained in the input datasets that encapsulate the pedagogic behaviour of users.</span>""</p> <p> </p> <p>""<span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">Additionally, pedagogy can be </span><span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-style: italic;"">explicitly </span><span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">addressed in the goals and objectives that the LA designer sets (“objectives” dimension). The LA method (“instruments” dimension) will determine the outcome of the analysis and together with the interpretation applied may lead to a large variety of options for consequences and interventions"" </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">""It is therefore our conviction that only the consideration of all six dimensions in the design process can lead to optimal exploitation of LA. Additionally, substantial work on new ethical guidance, data curation, and ownership needs to happen at universities and in legislation to reduce the risks connected to the application of LA and to protect the data subject, usually the learner.</span>""</p> <p> </p> <p>""<span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">In its most optimistic outlook, learners will be provided with personal information about their current needs, while, at the same time, the educational system will be evolved from a “one- size-fits-all” approach into a highly personal competence-driven educational experience. But this view is not without flaws, because of the real dangers that the extended and organised collection of learner data may not so much bring added benefits to the individual, but instead provides a tool for HEIs, companies, or governments to increase manipulative control over students, employees, and citizens, thereby abusing LA as a means to reinforce segregation, peer pressure, and conformism rather than to help construct a needs-driven learning society. We therefore believe that it will be of critical importance for its acceptance that the development of LA takes a bottom-up approach focused on the interests of the learners as the main driving force.</span>""</p> </div> </div> </div>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are a number of conceptual approaches that might be of assistance. Systems theory, for example, suggests two domains: material and informational. Material things are ""conserved"" in the sense that they can only be located at one node of the network at a time. Movements of people between organizations, money between people, automobiles between cities, and the like are all examples of material things which move between nodes -- and hence establish a network of material relations. Informational things, to the systems theorist, are ""non-conserved"" in the sense that they can be in more than one place at the same time. If I know something and share it with you, we both now know it. In a sense, the commonality that is shared by the exchange of information may also be said to establish a tie between two nodes. One needs to be cautious here, however, not to confuse the simple possession of a common attribute (e.g. gender) with the presence of a tie (e.g. the exchange of views between two persons on issues of gender).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p> <p><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><strong><em>Binary measures of relations</em>:</strong> By far the most common approach to scaling (assigning numbers to) relations is to simply distinguish between relations being absent (coded zero), and ties being present (coded one). If we ask respondents in a survey to tell us ""which other people on this list do you like?"" we are doing binary measurement. Each person from the list that is selected is coded one.

We might score each person on the list as having a relationship of type ""1"" type ""2"" etc. This kind of a scale is nominal or qualitative -- each person's relationship to the subject is coded by its type, rather than its strength.

The result is a grouped ordinal scale (i.e., there can be more than one ""liked"" person, and the categories reflect an underlying rank order of intensity). Usually, this kind of three point scale was coded -1, 0, and +1 to reflect negative liking, indifference, and positive liking. When scored this way, the pluses and minuses make it fairly easy to write algorithms that will count and describe various network properties (e.g. the structural balance of the graph).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p> <p> </p>","/Users/blakeschool/Zotero/storage/FTT3KCSI/C1_Social_Network_Data.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fifty-three infants, randomized into one of four treatment groups, received 8 ml. per kilogram of a solution containing either (A) glucose in water, (B) salt-poor albumin, (C) NaHCO3, or (D) a combination of albumin and NaHCO3. After the initial infusion, the babies received no colloid or alkali solutions until 4 hours of age. We managed them supportively with warmth, appropriate oxygen administration, isotonic fluid infusion, and close monitoring. Among the infants who received alkali, 14 of 26 acquired the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 11 died, and four had intracranial hemorrhage. Among babies who received no alkali, RDS occurred in 11 of 27, 5 died, and none had intracranial hemorrhage. These results do not support the common practice of rapidly infusing NaHCO3 into high-risk, premature infants, and they suggest that the early management of such infants needs renewed critical evaluation.","1976-02-01","2017-10-30 01:59:56","2017-10-30 01:59:56","","263-267","","3","124","","Am.
