However, whilst education is undoubtedly a powerful socialisation force, it is not the only factor that is likely to influence young people's civic and political participation. Political science theories regarding adult participation highlight the role of variables such as socio-economic background, political efficacy, individuals' assessments of the costs and benefits of participation and interest in politics. The questions therefore arise as to how much citizenship education can influence young people's participation above and beyond these other factors and whether this is more likely if a school adopts a particular approach to the subject's delivery. To answer these questions, this paper draws on data from the nine-year Citizenship Education Longitudinal Study (CELS), and more particularly from its 2004-05 survey of 13,646 English students aged 13-14. Structural equation modelling is used to examine students' intentions to participate and ascertain the relative contribution that education and other factors make to young people's intentions to participate.","2009-02","2017-10-25 22:52:50","2017-10-25 22:52:50","2017-10-25 22:52:50","1-20","","1","12","","Journal of Youth Studies","Young people's intended civic and political participation","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","citizenship; Education; ENGLAND; POLITICAL participation; POLITICAL science; politics; schooling; YOUNG adults","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study investigates whether students’ individual and collective participation predict students’ perceptions of school climate. We examine survey and administrative data from 4,947 students from 11 middle schools. Using multilevel modeling we examine the association of aggregate civic participation at the grade cohort level with school climate. Cohort-level civic participation has a significant positive association with perceived school climate, specifically student–teacher relationships, the fairness of school rules, and democratic climate. These aggregate associations are estimated over and above individual-level civic participation, which is independently predictive of school climate. Results demonstrate that students’ civic participation is associated with positive individual and setting-level outcomes, such as positive perceptions of school climate. Limitations of this study and suggestions for future research are discussed.","2016-03-01","2017-10-25 22:50:56","2017-10-25 22:50:56","2017-10-25 22:50:56","166-181","","2","44","","J.

Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.","1994-12-01","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2013-04-21 21:21:19","253-278","","4","4","","User Model User-Adap Inter","Knowledge tracing","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu","","","","","","","Education (general); empirical validity; individual differences; intelligent tutoring systems; Learning; Management of Computing and Information Systems; mastery learning; Multimedia Information Systems; procedural knowledge; Psychology, general; student modeling; User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The author outlines the ways in which schools act as civic institutions and analyzes how theories of school effects might be applied to hypotheses regarding youth civic behavior and attitudes. The author provides two examples of mechanisms that provide unique pathways to civic learning in schools – student diversity and the existence of a micro-political environment – and discusses the consequences of the unequal distribution of civic opportunities in schools.

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<p>There has been an explosion of available data, much of which is promising in its use in education</p> <p>Hopes to reduce delivery costs, improve learning effectiveness, accelerate development, etc. </p> <p>Data mining is more economical than past collection strategies which makes is more common, reflects real user behavior</p> <p>proliferation of interactive learning platforms etc. produces significant quantities of tracking data</p> <p>questions of data ownership and openness, compatibility of education data sets&nbsp;</p> <p>6 critical dimensions of LA</p> <p>1. internal limitations</p> <p>-competences and acceptance</p> <p>2. external constrains</p> <p>-conventions and norms, laws/policies/standards</p> <p>-ethical policies of the field, legal protections of individual data, institutional constraints&nbsp;</p> <p>3. stakeholders</p> <p>-data clients and data subjects; requires hierarchical data flow</p> <p>4. objectives</p> <p>-reflection and prediction</p> <p>5. data</p> <p>-challenge of public availability of data</p> <p>-problem with the common assumption that data sets consist of only meaningful, context-free data</p> <p>6. instruments</p> <p>-utilize different techs to retrieve information</p> <p>-includes conceptual instruments</p> <p>all 6 elements critical to have a fully formulated LA framework</p> <p>technologies are not pedagologically neutral so evaluation will be influenced by analytical approach chosen </p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Not only should they give students the knowledge they need to enter the labour market, they should also teach young people about democracy, and develop students’ capacity to exercise their citizenship. A third task for schools is to enhance political equality in society by supporting the least privileged students. In this study, we explore how school can contribute to increased equality by strengthening students’ political efficacy. Upper secondary students’ political efficacy levels are compared over time by creating four groups on the basis of their educational choices and experiences of the school and teaching environment. The results indicate that school matters for the development of political efficacy, but not in the same ways for all students. Signs of there being compensatory effects of having a positive school/teaching environment are found for students on vocational programmes, but not for those on academic programmes. Moreover, the results suggest that classroom/teaching factors play a more important role than the social environment offered by schools.","2015-03-15","2017-10-25 22:53:14","2017-10-25 22:53:14","2017-10-25 22:53:14","133-163","","2","30","","","The school’s role in youths’ political efficacy","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/abbeykeener/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/nlgcmsz9.default/zotero/storage/M8NSI3E5/Sohl and Arensmeier - 2015 - The school’s role in youths’ political efficacy c.pdf; /Users/abbeykeener/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/nlgcmsz9.default/zotero/storage/AHVICDWI/02671522.2014.html","","","DEMOCRACY; political efficacy; political equality; school","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method.

It requires a thorough understanding of the subject matter and of the cognitive factors that determine student performance. The skills definition, and the mapping of item to skills, require the involvement of experts. We investigate means to assist experts for this task by using a data driven, matrix factorization approach. The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on one side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise. The prediction comparison shows the factorization approach performs slightly better than the original expert Q-matrix, giving supporting evidence to the belief that the factorization mapping is valid. Implications for the use of the factorization to design better item to skills mapping are discussed.","2013-07-09","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2016-09-03 20:44:11","441-450","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","en","©2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","","","","link.springer.com","","","","","https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","","alternating least squares matrix factorization; Artificial Intelligence (incl.

The present paper aims to analyze the possible impact that schools can have in mitigating the effect of parents' socioeconomic status on students' expected electoral participation, focusing on two variables: civic knowledge and classroom climate. The analyses are based on a series of multilevel models using Chilean data of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2009. The results support the influence of students' socioeconomic background on expected electoral participation. Furthermore, civic knowledge and classroom climate show a positive and similar influence on students' expected participation. However, classroom climate appears less affected by students' background than civic knowledge, opening the discussion about which strategy should be emphasized when aiming to mitigate the political participation gap.","2015-02","2017-10-25 22:44:11","2017-10-25 22:44:11","2017-10-25 22:44:11","16-35","","1","18","","Journal of Youth Studies","Mitigating the political participation gap from the school","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","citizenship; civic knowledge; classroom climate; CLASSROOM environment; EMPIRICAL research; POLITICAL participation; SOCIAL background; SOCIAL status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.","2008-04","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2017-09-11 03:49:18","2016-09-04 01:23:19","","","","","","","","","","","","EUROSIS","Porto, Spain","eng","openAccess","","","","repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt","","","","","http://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/8024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5th Annual Future Business Technology Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focusing on citizens' transitions in and out of voluntary associations, we tested four possible explanations for the well-documented correlation between civic engagement and political socialization. Two are due to self-selection effects (pools of democracy), and two are due to socialization effects (schools of democracy). Our analyses offer little support for the idea of voluntary associations playing a major role in political socialization processes: our latent growth curve models showed no or very little increase of political discussion, interest, efficacy, and action among those who became actively involved in voluntary associations. In contrast, we found convincing evidence for our pools-of-democracy hypotheses, and the self-selection turns out to be a double-edged sword: politically engaged citizens are more likely to join voluntary associations and less likely to leave them. These findings challenge the conclusions of many studies based on cross-sectional data.","2016-03","2017-10-25 22:50:50","2017-10-25 22:50:50","2017-10-25 22:50:50","83-103","","1","38","","Political Behavior","Schools or Pools of Democracy?","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","ASSOCIATION management; Civic engagement; DEMOCRACY; Political action; Political interest; POLITICAL participation; POLITICAL socialization; PRESSURE groups; Voluntary association; Volunteering; VOLUNTEER service","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, it typically comprises the following: defining a construct; specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can nevertheless have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses.

This study used a quasi-experimental design to examine longer-term effects of the Student Voices program, which was originally evaluated in Philadelphia public high schools during the 2002–2003 school year. Following the 2004 presidential election, researchers recontacted students who had participated in the program for one or two semesters and students who had been in control civics classrooms. A structural equation model indicated that students who experienced two semesters of the program reported greater self-efficacy for political participation and that this effect carried over to increased political attentiveness as well as to knowledge of candidate positions. In addition, political attentiveness increased knowledge and voting in the election. However, neither knowledge nor efficacy had direct effects on voting once attentiveness was controlled. The results suggest that a supplementary civics education program such as Student Voices can increase subsequent participation in politics by building long-term gains in political self-efficacy and skills in using the news media to follow government and political affairs.","2008-03-05","2017-10-25 22:46:16","2017-10-25 22:46:16","2017-10-25 22:46:16","26-37","","1","12","","","Schools as Incubators of Democratic Participation","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/abbeykeener/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/nlgcmsz9.default/zotero/storage/KIH6JEBN/Pasek et al. - 2008 - Schools as Incubators of Democratic Participation.pdf; /Users/abbeykeener/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/nlgcmsz9.default/zotero/storage/ZP7A28QS/10888690801910526.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Learning analytics are a specific incarnation of the bigger shift to an algorithmically pervaded society, and their wider impact on education needs careful consideration. In this chapter, we argue that by design — or else by accident — the use of a learning analytics tool is always aligned with assessment regimes, which are in turn grounded in epistemological assumptions and pedagogical practices. Fundamentally then, we argue that deploying a given learning analytics tool expresses a commitment to a particular educational worldview, designed to nurture particular kinds of learners. We outline some key provocations in the development of learning analytic techniques, key questions to draw out the purpose and assumptions built into learning analytics. We suggest that using “claims analysis” — analysis of the implicit or explicit stances taken in the design and deploying of technologies — is a productive human-centred method to address these key questions, and we offer some examples of the method applied to those provocations.","2017","2017-09-28 01:51:59","2017-09-28 01:57:48","","17-22","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lang, Charles; George Siemens; Alyssa Wise; Dragan Gašević","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","First","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study controls for demographic factors, preexisting civic commitments, and academic test scores. Prior large-scale studies that found limited impact from school-based civic education often did not focus on the content and style of the curriculum and instruction. Discussing civic and political issues with one’s parents, extracurricular activities other than sports, and living in a civically responsive neighborhood also appear to meaningfully support this goal. Other school characteristics appear less influential.","2008-09-01","2017-10-25 22:46:32","2017-10-25 22:46:32","2017-10-25 22:46:32","738-766","","3","45","","American Educational Research Journal","Developing Citizens","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","","","/Users/abbeykeener/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/nlgcmsz9.default/zotero/storage/R67JQK4N/Kahne and Sporte - 2008 - Developing Citizens The Impact of Civic Learning .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

We find that young adults with a history of school suspension are less likely than others to vote and volunteer in civic activities years later, suggesting that suspension negatively impacts the likelihood that youth engage in future political and civic activities. These findings are consistent with prior theory and research highlighting the long-term negative implications of punitive disciplinary policies and the role schools play in preparing youth to participate in a democratic polity. We conclude that suspension undermines the development of the individual skills and capacities necessary for a democratic society by substituting collaborative problem solving for the exclusion and physical removal of students. The research lends empirical grounds for recommending the reform of school governance and the implementation of more constructive models of discipline.","2015-01-01","2017-10-25 22:48:05","2017-10-25 22:48:05","2017-10-25 22:48:05","95-124","","1","47","","Youth & Society","Discipline and Participation","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","","","/Users/abbeykeener/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/nlgcmsz9.default/zotero/storage/D8EVZ3GG/Kupchik and Catlaw - 2015 - Discipline and Participation The Long-Term Effect.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
