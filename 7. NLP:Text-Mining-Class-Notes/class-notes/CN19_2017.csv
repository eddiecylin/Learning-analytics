Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies. Our aims are to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analyses to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so, in the process inspiring future educational studies incorporating relational data.","2014-06-20","2017-09-08 13:40:00","2017-09-08 13:40:00","2014-08-20 20:21:46","167-178","","2","13","","CBE Life Sci Educ","Understanding Classrooms through Social Network Analysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.lifescied.org","","","","","http://www.lifescied.org/content/13/2/167","Week 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Every passing day, Genomics and Proteomics yield bucketloads of multivariate data (genes, proteins, DNA, identified peptides, structures), and every one of these biological data units are described by a number of features: length, physicochemical properties, scores, etc. Careful consideration of which features to select when trying to reduce the dimensionality of a specific dataset is, therefore, critical if one wishes to analyze and understand their impact on a model, or to identify what attributes produce a specific biological effect. For instance, considering a predictive model C1A1 + C2A2 + C3A3 … CnAn = S, where Ci are constants, Ai are features or attributes and S is the predictor output (retention time, toxicity, score, etc). It is essential to identify which of those features (A1, A2 and A3…An) are most relevant to the model and to understand how they correlate with S, as working with such a subset will enable the researcher to discard a lot of irrelevant and redundant information. There are two main approaches to this selection process:  Filter approaches: you select the features first, then you use this subset to execute classification or clustering algorithms, etc; Embedded or Wrapper approaches a classification algorithm is applied to the raw dataset in order to identify the most relevant features. One of the simplest and most powerful filter approaches is the use of  correlation matrix filters. In regression and data mining problems, variables may be highly correlated with one another or ""redundant"". For example in cheminformatics, aromatic rings, bond counts and carbon atom counts can be very tightly correlated. If so, any one of these variables could be used as a proxy for all the others. It is best to choose the feature which is most likely to be the direct cause of toxicity, absorption or a specific response distribution.  Correlation Matrix :R Example: Removing features with more than 0.70 of Correlation.import java.util.List;library(corrplot)#corrplot: the library to compute correlation matrix.datMy <- read.table(""data.csv"", header = TRUE)#read the tab file using the read table function.datMy.scale<- scale(datMy[2:ncol(datMy)],center=TRUE,scale=TRUE);#scale all the features (from feature 2 bacause feature 1 is the predictor output)corMatMy <- cor(datMy.scale)#compute the correlation matrixcorrplot(corMatMy, order = ""hclust"")#visualize the matrix, clustering features by correlation index. Resulting Output: Highly Correlate Matrix for 400 features.  After inspecting the matrix, we set the correlation threshold at 0.70.highlyCor <- findCorrelation(corMatMy, 0.70)#Apply correlation filter at 0.70,#then we remove all the variable correlated with more 0.7.datMyFiltered.scale <- datMy.scale[,-highlyCor]corMatMy <- cor(datMyFiltered.scale)corrplot(corMatMy, order = ""hclust"") Resulting Output: Correlation matrix after filter. Now it is possible to filter out “redundant” features by examining in detail the correlation matrix. Remember that the closer the correlation between two variables is to 1, the more related their behavior and the more redundant one is with respect to the other. Using PCA A relatively sophisticated way to do the correlation matrix analysis would be to perform a Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Feature extraction approaches transform data in high-dimensional space to a space of fewer dimensions. Principal component analysis, the most important linear technique for reducing dimensionality, performs a linear mapping of the data to a lower dimensional space in such a way that the variance of the data in the low-dimensional representation is maximized. In other words, PCA analysis builds a set of features by selecting those axes which maximize data variance. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate technique that summarizes systematic patterns of variation in the data. From a data analysis standpoint, PCA is used for studying one table of observations and variables with the idea of transforming the observed variables into a set of new variables, the principal components, which are uncorrelated and explain the variation of the data. Therefore, PCA can be used to bring down a “complex” data set to a lower dimensionality, in order to reveal the structures or the dominant types of variations in both the observations and the variables. PCA in R In R, several functions from a number of different packages can be used to perform PCA. My suggestion is FactoMineR whose typical PCA output consists of a set of eigenvalues, a table with the scores or Principal Components (PCs), and a table of loadings (or correlations between variables and PCs).R Example: PCA function using FactoMineR for 400 features & 5 PCs require(FactoMineR) # PCA with function PCAdatMy <- read.table(""data.csv"", header = TRUE)#read the tab file using the read table function.pca <- PCA(datMy, scale.unit=TRUE, ncp=5, graph=T)#scale all the features,  ncp: number of dimensions kept in the results (by default 5)dimdesc(pca)#This line of code will sort the variables the most linked to each PC. It is very useful when you have many variables. Here, you can find an excellent tutorial on FactoMineR and Principal Component analysis in R: Wrapper Approaches with Backwards Selection""Wrapper"" approaches can be viewed as built-in functions to optimize the number of predictors in the optimization or regression problem.  Many feature selection routines use a ""wrapper"" approach to find appropriate variables such that an algorithm searching through feature space repeatedly fits the model with different predictor sets. The best predictor set is determined by some measure of performance (correlation R^2, root-mean-square deviation). An example of one search routine is backwards selection (a.k.a. recursive feature elimination). In many cases, using these models with built-in feature selection will be more efficient than algorithms where the search routine for the right predictors is external to the model. Built-in feature selection typically couples the predictor search algorithm with parameter estimation, and is usually optimized with a single objective function (e.g. error rates or likelihood). Using Built-in Backward SelectionThe algorithm fits the model to all predictors. Each predictor is ranked according to relevance to the model. With each iteration of feature selection, the Ci top-ranked predictors are retained, the model is refit and performance is re-assessed. Built-in backward selection is being used for at least three purposes: predictor selection, model fitting and performance evaluation. Unless the number of samples is large, especially in relation to the number of variables, one static training set may not be able to fulfill these needs. The ""crantastic"" package caret contains functions for training and plotting classification and regression models. In this case, the rfe function is used to obtain the potential selection. It has several arguments:  x, a matrix or data frame of predictor variables y, a vector (numeric or factor) of outcomes sizes, an integer vector for the specific subset sizes that should be tested (which must not include ncol(x)) rfeControl, a list of options that can be used to specify the model and the methods for prediction, ranking etc.  For a specific model, a set of functions must be specified in rfeControl$functions. There are a number of pre-defined sets of functions for several models, including: linear regression (in the object lmFuncs), random forests (rfFuncs), naive Bayes (nbFuncs), bagged trees (treebagFuncs) and functions that can be used with caret's train function (caretFuncs). R example: Selecting features using backward selection and the caret package library(caret);#load caret librarydata_features<-as.matrix(read.table(""data-features.csv"",sep=""\t"", header=TRUE));#load data featuresdata_class<-as.matrix(read.table('data.csv', header=TRUE));#load data classesdata_features<- scale(data_features, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE);#scale data featuresinTrain <- createDataPartition(data_class, p = 3/4, list = FALSE); #Divide the dataset in train and test sets#Create the Training Dataset for Descriptors trainDescr <- data_features[inTrain,];# Create the Testing dataset for DescriptorstestDescr <- data_features[-inTrain,];trainClass <- data_class[inTrain];testClass <- data_class[-inTrain];descrCorr <- cor(trainDescr);highCorr <- findCorrelation(descrCorr, 0.70);trainDescr <- trainDescr[, -highCorr];testDescr <- testDescr[, -highCorr];# Here, we can included a correlation matrix analysis to remove the redundant features before the backwards selection svmProfile <- rfe(x=trainDescr, y = trainClass, sizes = c(1:5), rfeControl= rfeControl(functions = caretFuncs,number = 2),method = ""svmRadial"",fit = FALSE);#caret function: the rfe is the backwards selection, c is the possible sizes of the features sets, and method the optimization method is a support vector machine. Finally I would like to recommned an excellent Review about Feature Selection in Bioinformatics.","2013-10-17","2017-09-08 13:40:03","2017-09-08 13:40:03","2016-01-18 19:42:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://www.r-bloggers.com/introduction-to-feature-selection-for-bioinformaticians-using-r-correlation-matrix-filters-pca-backward-selection/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study, through the examination of longitudinal K-12 teacher assigned grading histories for entire cohorts of students from a school district (n=188), demonstrates a novel application of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization in which all data points collected on every student in a cohort can be patterned, visualized and interpreted to aid in data driven decision making by teachers and administrators. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method.

Understanding how learning relationships form in undergraduate classrooms, as well as the impacts these relationships have on learning outcomes, can inform educators in unique ways and improve educational reform. Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies. Our aims are to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analyses to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so, in the process inspiring future educational studies incorporating relational data.","2014-06-20","2017-09-14 15:44:52","2017-09-14 15:44:52","2014-08-20 20:21:46","167-178","","2","13","","CBE Life Sci Educ","Understanding Classrooms through Social Network Analysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.lifescied.org","","","<p>Key words</p> <p>Learning relationships - formation and impacts on learning outcomes.</p> <p>Social network analysis (SNA) - tool kit.</p> <p>Introduction and example.</p>","","http://www.lifescied.org/content/13/2/167","Week 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance.

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2017-09-14 15:44:55","2017-09-14 15:44:55","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<p>Two structures:</p> <p>- Dimensions of learning analytics; stakeholders; objectives; data; instruments; internal limitations; external constraints.</p> <p>- LA and pedagogy; Pedagogic behavior -&gt; LA -&gt; Pedagogic consequences -&gt; Pedagogic behavior.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

As such, it typically comprises the following: de ning a construct; specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive modelling are explored toward the end.","2017","2017-09-14 15:44:56","2017-09-14 15:44:56","","34-48","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<p>Use this article as a checklist to prep for Cert.</p>","","","","","Lang, Charles; Siemens, George; Wise, Alyssa Friend; Gaševic, Dragan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
