"GZ9YP8JX","blogPost","2013","Perez-Riverol, Yasset","Introduction to Feature selection for bioinformaticians using R, correlation matrix filters, PCA & backward selection","R-bloggers","","","","http://www.r-bloggers.com/introduction-to-feature-selection-for-bioinformaticians-using-r-correlation-matrix-filters-pca-backward-selection/","Bioinformatics is becoming more and more a Data Mining field. Every passing day, Genomics and Proteomics yield bucketloads of multivariate data (genes, proteins, DNA, identified peptides, structures), and every one of these biological data units are described by a number of features: length, physicochemical properties, scores, etc. Careful consideration of which features to select when trying to reduce the dimensionality of a specific dataset is, therefore, critical if one wishes to analyze and understand their impact on a model, or to identify what attributes produce a specific biological effect. For instance, considering a predictive model C1A1 + C2A2 + C3A3 … CnAn = S, where Ci are constants, Ai are features or attributes and S is the predictor output (retention time, toxicity, score, etc). It is essential to identify which of those features (A1, A2 and A3…An) are most relevant to the model and to understand how they correlate with S, as working with such a subset will enable the researcher to discard a lot of irrelevant and redundant information. There are two main approaches to this selection process:  Filter approaches: you select the features first, then you use this subset to execute classification or clustering algorithms, etc; Embedded or Wrapper approaches a classification algorithm is applied to the raw dataset in order to identify the most relevant features. One of the simplest and most powerful filter approaches is the use of  correlation matrix filters. In regression and data mining problems, variables may be highly correlated with one another or ""redundant"". For example in cheminformatics, aromatic rings, bond counts and carbon atom counts can be very tightly correlated. If so, any one of these variables could be used as a proxy for all the others. It is best to choose the feature which is most likely to be the direct cause of toxicity, absorption or a specific response distribution.  Correlation Matrix :R Example: Removing features with more than 0.70 of Correlation.import java.util.List;library(corrplot)#corrplot: the library to compute correlation matrix.datMy <- read.table(""data.csv"", header = TRUE)#read the tab file using the read table function.datMy.scale<- scale(datMy[2:ncol(datMy)],center=TRUE,scale=TRUE);#scale all the features (from feature 2 bacause feature 1 is the predictor output)corMatMy <- cor(datMy.scale)#compute the correlation matrixcorrplot(corMatMy, order = ""hclust"")#visualize the matrix, clustering features by correlation index. Resulting Output: Highly Correlate Matrix for 400 features.  After inspecting the matrix, we set the correlation threshold at 0.70.highlyCor <- findCorrelation(corMatMy, 0.70)#Apply correlation filter at 0.70,#then we remove all the variable correlated with more 0.7.datMyFiltered.scale <- datMy.scale[,-highlyCor]corMatMy <- cor(datMyFiltered.scale)corrplot(corMatMy, order = ""hclust"") Resulting Output: Correlation matrix after filter. Now it is possible to filter out “redundant” features by examining in detail the correlation matrix. Remember that the closer the correlation between two variables is to 1, the more related their behavior and the more redundant one is with respect to the other. Using PCA A relatively sophisticated way to do the correlation matrix analysis would be to perform a Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Feature extraction approaches transform data in high-dimensional space to a space of fewer dimensions. Principal component analysis, the most important linear technique for reducing dimensionality, performs a linear mapping of the data to a lower dimensional space in such a way that the variance of the data in the low-dimensional representation is maximized. In other words, PCA analysis builds a set of features by selecting those axes which maximize data variance. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate technique that summarizes systematic patterns of variation in the data. From a data analysis standpoint, PCA is used for studying one table of observations and variables with the idea of transforming the observed variables into a set of new variables, the principal components, which are uncorrelated and explain the variation of the data. Therefore, PCA can be used to bring down a “complex” data set to a lower dimensionality, in order to reveal the structures or the dominant types of variations in both the observations and the variables. PCA in R In R, several functions from a number of different packages can be used to perform PCA. My suggestion is FactoMineR whose typical PCA output consists of a set of eigenvalues, a table with the scores or Principal Components (PCs), and a table of loadings (or correlations between variables and PCs).R Example: PCA function using FactoMineR for 400 features & 5 PCs require(FactoMineR) # PCA with function PCAdatMy <- read.table(""data.csv"", header = TRUE)#read the tab file using the read table function.pca <- PCA(datMy, scale.unit=TRUE, ncp=5, graph=T)#scale all the features,  ncp: number of dimensions kept in the results (by default 5)dimdesc(pca)#This line of code will sort the variables the most linked to each PC. It is very useful when you have many variables. Here, you can find an excellent tutorial on FactoMineR and Principal Component analysis in R: Wrapper Approaches with Backwards Selection""Wrapper"" approaches can be viewed as built-in functions to optimize the number of predictors in the optimization or regression problem.  Many feature selection routines use a ""wrapper"" approach to find appropriate variables such that an algorithm searching through feature space repeatedly fits the model with different predictor sets. The best predictor set is determined by some measure of performance (correlation R^2, root-mean-square deviation). An example of one search routine is backwards selection (a.k.a. recursive feature elimination). In many cases, using these models with built-in feature selection will be more efficient than algorithms where the search routine for the right predictors is external to the model. Built-in feature selection typically couples the predictor search algorithm with parameter estimation, and is usually optimized with a single objective function (e.g. error rates or likelihood). Using Built-in Backward SelectionThe algorithm fits the model to all predictors. Each predictor is ranked according to relevance to the model. With each iteration of feature selection, the Ci top-ranked predictors are retained, the model is refit and performance is re-assessed. Built-in backward selection is being used for at least three purposes: predictor selection, model fitting and performance evaluation. Unless the number of samples is large, especially in relation to the number of variables, one static training set may not be able to fulfill these needs. The ""crantastic"" package caret contains functions for training and plotting classification and regression models. In this case, the rfe function is used to obtain the potential selection. It has several arguments:  x, a matrix or data frame of predictor variables y, a vector (numeric or factor) of outcomes sizes, an integer vector for the specific subset sizes that should be tested (which must not include ncol(x)) rfeControl, a list of options that can be used to specify the model and the methods for prediction, ranking etc.  For a specific model, a set of functions must be specified in rfeControl$functions. There are a number of pre-defined sets of functions for several models, including: linear regression (in the object lmFuncs), random forests (rfFuncs), naive Bayes (nbFuncs), bagged trees (treebagFuncs) and functions that can be used with caret's train function (caretFuncs). R example: Selecting features using backward selection and the caret package library(caret);#load caret librarydata_features<-as.matrix(read.table(""data-features.csv"",sep=""\t"", header=TRUE));#load data featuresdata_class<-as.matrix(read.table('data.csv', header=TRUE));#load data classesdata_features<- scale(data_features, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE);#scale data featuresinTrain <- createDataPartition(data_class, p = 3/4, list = FALSE); #Divide the dataset in train and test sets#Create the Training Dataset for Descriptors trainDescr <- data_features[inTrain,];# Create the Testing dataset for DescriptorstestDescr <- data_features[-inTrain,];trainClass <- data_class[inTrain];testClass <- data_class[-inTrain];descrCorr <- cor(trainDescr);highCorr <- findCorrelation(descrCorr, 0.70);trainDescr <- trainDescr[, -highCorr];testDescr <- testDescr[, -highCorr];# Here, we can included a correlation matrix analysis to remove the redundant features before the backwards selection svmProfile <- rfe(x=trainDescr, y = trainClass, sizes = c(1:5), rfeControl= rfeControl(functions = caretFuncs,number = 2),method = ""svmRadial"",fit = FALSE);#caret function: the rfe is the backwards selection, c is the possible sizes of the features sets, and method the optimization method is a support vector machine. Finally I would like to recommned an excellent Review about Feature Selection in Bioinformatics.","2013-10-17","2017-11-28 17:27:36","2017-11-28 17:27:36","2016-01-18 19:42:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://www.r-bloggers.com/introduction-to-feature-selection-for-bioinformaticians-using-r-correlation-matrix-filters-pca-backward-selection/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies.

Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.","1994-12-01","2017-11-28 17:27:49","2017-11-28 17:27:49","2013-04-21 21:21:19","253-278","","4","4","","User Model User-Adap Inter","Knowledge tracing","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu","","","<p> - This paper describes an effort to model students' changing knowledge state during skill acquisition<br />- In this paper we attempt to bring a cognitive model of skill acquisition to bear on the goals of mastery learning.<br />- This theory assumes a fundamental distinction between declarative knowledge and procedural knowledge.

We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

The rows of the array are the cases, or subjects, or observations.<br />-the columns and rows are the same unit, like the individual or whatever is the focus in the social network<br />-in this format, the cell describes the relationship between the actors in some regard<br />-this form of the data allows one to see how certain actors are embedded in a wider network<br />-But a network analyst is also likely to look at the data structure in a second way -- holistically. The analyst might note that there are about equal numbers of ones and zeros in the matrix. This suggests that there is a moderate ""density"" of liking overall. <br />-The analyst might also compare the cells above and below the diagonal to see if there is reciprocity in choices (e.g. Bob chose Ted, did Ted choose Bob?)<br />-holistic patterns are seen in network analysis<br />-One can think of the rows as simply a listing of cases, and the columns as attributes of each actor (i.e. the relations with other actors can be thought of as ""attributes"" of each actor). <br />-Indeed, many of the techniques used by network analysts (like calculating correlations and distances) are applied exactly the same way to network data as they would be to conventional data.<br />-the network analysts see the connections holistically, the focus is on relationships<br />-The difference in emphasis is consequential for the choices that a researcher must make in deciding on research design, in conducting sampling, developing measurement, and handling the resulting data<br /><br />Nodes<br />-Actors: nodes<br />-relations: edges<br />-there is no focus on the individuals and their attributes, only their relationships<br />-as a result network data is not sampled independently<br />-the notes are the result of probability sampling<br />-have whole population usuallt, not samples<br />-""nested"" designs: Most social network analysts think of individual persons as being embedded in networks that are embedded in networks that are embedded in networks.<br />-micro-relationships<br />-sampling networks from wider populations<br /><br />Relations (edges)<br />-the other hald of social network data<br />-many ways to measure edges<br />full network: full network data give a complete picture of relations in the population<br />-can be very expensive to get this type of data<br />-snowball method: Each of these actors is asked to name some or all of their ties to other actors. Then, all the actors named (who were not part of the original list) are tracked down and asked for some or all of their ties. The process continues until no new actors are identified, or until we decide to stop (usually for reasons of time and resources, or because the new actors being named are very marginal to the group we are trying to study).<br />-ego-centric: use focal points<br /><br /><br />-in social network only a single piece of information is shared by each person/unit<br />-scalues of measurement are similar to other data and can affect what techniques you can use<br />-<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>","","http://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/nettext/C1_Social_Network_Data.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining.
