This study, through the examination of longitudinal K-12 teacher assigned grading histories for entire cohorts of students from a school district (n=188), demonstrates a novel application of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization in which all data points collected on every student in a cohort can be patterned, visualized and interpreted to aid in data driven decision making by teachers and administrators. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method.

Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams.

Of course, with education data covering each student, teachers can know a student's idiosyncratic learning styles and provide this student with tailored advice in terms of how to effectively grasp the stuff the teacher is teaching. But this is only possible when the class size is not too big so that the teacher has the time to analyze and interpret the meaning behind the data and communicate with students to confirm the teacher's understanding of the data. If the the class contains, say, 50 students, the teacher will end up getting herself or himself too busy with dealing with education data, deprived of time to think about how to improve her or his teaching itself. With a big class in hand, the teacher may have to leave each student analyzing her data by herself.

This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process.

In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive modelling are explored toward the end.","2017","2017-09-14 15:51:35","2017-09-14 15:51:35","","34-48","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<p>For me who major in measurement and evaluation, this article has provided a systematic review of the theories and other relevant issues in psychometrics.

This effort is worthwhile and necessary since former ethic rules, although providing some insight for learning analytics, may be not applicable good enough. The introduction of the history of ethics for learning analytics is informative, allowing us to trace the history back to the Open University, the operation of which accumulates a large amount of data and makes it necessary to lay down rules concerning how to protect the data of the University's students. The article mentions ethic principles established by many different institutions and conferences, which means that for now there still lacks a popular set of rules acceptable to most, if not all, learning analytics researchers and practitioners. Anyhow, a good point of this article is that in the future interested organizations may refer to this article for inspiration when they need to establish their own ethic rules. Perhaps one day learning analytics institutions' leaders may sit together and produce a set of rules covering almost all possible uses of education data.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus is on cognitive model discovery where researchers use Q-matrix (including KC's) and AFM to discover new KC's that have better fit than expert-defined KC's. The article mentions three models: DFA, LFA, and SimStuden (software). By comparing results to models only with expert efforts, the authors found that the automated cognitive models have better fits.</p> <p>The conclusion of this article is balanced. The authors emphasize the role of experts in exploring cognitive models, which they believe tends to make the derived models more interpretable, although another article in the reading of several weeks ago promotes totally automated modeling.</p> <p>For interpretability, the authors have included both understanding why and how: Why some variables should be included, and how the results can help to improve instructions. Of course, the authors also stress that both independent and dependent variables should correspond to constructs.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The argument of the authors that statisticians should focus on making comparisons, presenting information, and discovering patterns from data is convincing, and this cogency of argument is reflected in the multitude of examples in the article. Many so-called ""best"" graphs from the Infovis world, although able to catch attention, are no use in giving much information about the data. Finally, the author's suggestion that experts from both fields should learn from each other is a helpful attempt to bridge the gap between the graphs from both groups.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
