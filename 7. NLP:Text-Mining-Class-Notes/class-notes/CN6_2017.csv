This study, through the examination of longitudinal K-12 teacher assigned grading histories for entire cohorts of students from a school district (n=188), demonstrates a novel application of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization in which all data points collected on every student in a cohort can be patterned, visualized and interpreted to aid in data driven decision making by teachers and administrators. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method. Hierarchical cluster analysis correctly identified over 80% of the students who dropped out using the entire student grade history patterns from either K-12 or K-8.

Understanding how learning relationships form in undergraduate classrooms, as well as the impacts these relationships have on learning outcomes, can inform educators in unique ways and improve educational reform. Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies. Our aims are to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analyses to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so, in the process inspiring future educational studies incorporating relational data.","2014-06-20","2017-09-14 16:00:41","2017-09-14 16:00:41","2014-08-20 20:21:46","167-178","","2","13","","CBE Life Sci Educ","Understanding Classrooms through Social Network Analysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.lifescied.org","","","<p>NOTE:</p> <p>Nodes within a network also have their own set of measurements.

As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process.

It’s the ratio between the number of correct predictions<br />and the total number of predictions (the number of data points in<br />the test set):<br />accuracy = # correct predictions/ # total data points</p> <p><strong>Confusion Matrix</strong></p> <p>Accuracy looks easy enough. However, it makes no distinction<br />between classes; correct answers for class 0 and class 1 are treated<br />equally—sometimes this is not enough. One might want to look at<br />how many examples failed for class 0 versus class 1, because the cost<br />of misclassification might differ for the two classes, or one might<br />have a lot more test data of one class than the other. For example,<br />when a doctor makes a medical diagnosis that a patient has cancer<br />when he doesn’t (known as a false positive) has very different consequences<br />than making the call that a patient doesn’t have cancer<br />when he does (a false negative).</p> <p><strong>Log-Loss</strong><br />Log-loss, or logarithmic loss, gets into the finer details of a classifier.<br />In particular, if the raw output of the classifier is a numeric probability<br />instead of a class label of 0 or 1, then log-loss can be used. The<br />probability can be understood as a gauge of confidence. If the true<br />label is 0 but the classifier thinks it belongs to class 1 with probability<br />0.51, then even though the classifier would be making a mistake,<br />it’s a near miss because the probability is very close to the decision<br />boundary of 0.5.</p> <p><strong>AUC</strong></p> <p>it shows you howmany correct positive classifications can be gained as you allow for<br />more and more false positives. The perfect classifier that makes no<br />mistakes would hit a true positive rate of 100% immediately, without<br />incurring any false positives—this almost never happens in practice.</p> <p><strong>Precision-Recall</strong><br />Precision and recall are actually two metrics. But they are often used<br />together. Precision answers the question, “Out of the items that the<br />ranker/classifier predicted to be relevant, how many are truly relevant?”<br />Whereas, recall answers the question, “Out of all the items<br />that are truly relevant, how many are found by the ranker/classifier?”<br />Figure 2-3 contains a simple Venn diagram that illustrates precision<br />versus recall.</p> <p><strong>RMSE</strong><br />The most commonly used metric for regression tasks is RMSE<br />(root-mean-square error), also known as RMSD (root-mean-square<br />deviation). This is defined as the square root of the average squared<br />distance between the actual score and the predicted score:</p>","","http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/evaluating-machine-learning-models.csp?intcmp=il-data-free-lp-lgen_free_reports_page","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.
