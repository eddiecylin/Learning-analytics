This study, through the examination of longitudinal K-12 teacher assigned grading histories for entire cohorts of students from a school district (n=188), demonstrates a novel application of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization in which all data points collected on every student in a cohort can be patterned, visualized and interpreted to aid in data driven decision making by teachers and administrators. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method. Hierarchical cluster analysis correctly identified over 80% of the students who dropped out using the entire student grade history patterns from either K-12 or K-8.

Understanding how learning relationships form in undergraduate classrooms, as well as the impacts these relationships have on learning outcomes, can inform educators in unique ways and improve educational reform. Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies. Our aims are to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analyses to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so, in the process inspiring future educational studies incorporating relational data.","2014-06-20","2017-09-14 16:00:56","2017-09-14 16:00:56","2014-08-20 20:21:46","167-178","","2","13","","CBE Life Sci Educ","Understanding Classrooms through Social Network Analysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.lifescied.org","","","<p>""Network analysis can inform our understanding of student network formation in classrooms and the types of impacts these networks have on students""</p> <p>""Network analysis entails two broad classes of hypotheses: those that seek to understand what influences the formation of relational ties in a given population (e.g., having the same major, having relational partners in common), and those that consider the influence that the structure of ties has on shaping outcomes, at either the individual level (e.g., grade point average [GPA] or socioeconomic status) or the population level (e.g., graduation rates or retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics [STEM] disciplines).""</p> <p>""SNA helps us to understand how relationships form, what kinds of relational structures emerge from the building blocks of individual relationships between pairs of actors, and what, if any, the impacts are of these relationships on actors. Actors, also called nodes, can be individuals, organizations, websites, or any entity that can be connected to other entities.

Realworld networks are rarely static; ties form, break, strengthen and weaken over time.""</p> <p>""Degree centrality represents the total number of connections a node has. In networks in which relations are directional, this includes measures ofindegree and outdegree, or the number of edges pointing to or away from an actor, respectively. Degree centrality is often useful for examining the equity or inequity in the number of ties between individuals and can be done by looking at the degree distribution, which shows the distribution of degrees over an entire network. Betweenness centrality focuses on whether actors serve as bridges in the shortest paths between two actors. Actors with high betweenness centrality have a high probability of existing as a link on the shortest path (geodesic) between any two actors in a network. If one were to look at an airport network (airports connected by flights), airports serving as main hubs, such as Chicago O’Hare and London Heathrow, would have high betweenness, as they connect many cities with no direct flights between them""</p>","","http://www.lifescied.org/content/13/2/167","Week 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2017-09-14 16:01:00","2017-09-14 16:01:00","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<p>""It is expected that personalised learning has the potential to reduce delivery costs while at the same time creating more effective learning experiences, accelerating competence development, and increasing collaboration between learners.""</p> <p>""The fundamental question legislators need to ask is: who does a person’s life data belong to?""</p> <p>""provides a tool for HEIs, companies, or governments to increase manipulative control over students, employees, and citizens, thereby abusing LA as a means to reinforce segregation, peer pressure, and conformism rather than to help construct a needs-driven learning society.""</p> <p>""LA processes that data can be interpreted in many ways and lead to very different consequent actions.

Explanatory models seek to identify interpertable causal relationships between constructs that can be either observed or inferred from the data. The vast majority of educational data mining research has focused on achieving predictive accuracy, but we argue that the field could benefit from more focus on developing explanatory models. We review examples of educational data mining efforts that have produced explanatory models and led to improvements to learning outcomes and/or learning theory.
