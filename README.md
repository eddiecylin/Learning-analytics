This repository stores several original data analytics/data science projects I've completed. The materials of the a project are store in the same folder. Feel free to use my dataset or code if you find them useful. Also, please let me know if you have feedback, comments, or questions(eddie.lin@tc.columbia.edu). The following are brief descriptions of each project and quick access to each project's write-up in the format of PDF or README.md.

## [Coursera Forum Post Analysis: Investigating User Interaction across 28 MOOCs](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-analytics/blob/master/8.%20Coursera_forum_analysis/README.md)

Project description:        
This project uses data from discussion threads from 28 Coursera MOOCs, as well as, focuses on the user interaction revealed by their online activities of forum posts and replies. All of these 28 Coursera MOOCs focus on quantitative knowledge and programing skills including data analytics, machine learning, finance, statistics, etc. This project aims to use exploratory data analysis and data visualization to answer the questions in the following:

1. What is the relation between the number of course users, number of forum posts, and views of forum posts?
2. Using frequency counts and time lapse for post replies as index for user interaction, which course has the highest/lowest user interaction?
3. What is the ratio of forum posts by different types of participants across 28 courses?
4. What is the general pattern of post replies? Does a forum post elicit many replies mostly from a few users (concentrated) or fewer replies but from several users (spread out)?


## [User Behavior Analysis of ASSISTments online Tutor System](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-analytics/blob/master/6.%20Online-Tutoring-ASSISTments/README.md)

Project description:        
What are the behavioral differences between high- and low-performing students in an online tutoring enviroment? Do those differences determine who is more successful v.s who is not? This project uses a large dataset from collected from the ASSISTments tutor system to investigate these questions. Specifically questions include:

1. What are the key behavioral features that could distinguish high and low-performance users?
2. Using classification predictive models, can we use these key behavioral features to predict the outcome of question attempt?
3. Which predictive model performs the best, especially, to predict who's likely to answer a question correctly(true positive)?

## [NLP/Text Mining: Analyzing Students' Note-Taking Behavior in A Graduate Class](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-analytics/blob/master/7.%20NLP:Text-Mining-Class-Notes/README.md)

Project description:        
Using students notes from a graduate-level class that teaches machine learning/data analytics, this project aims to apply NLP/text mining analysis to exploring students' motivation to take notes and the nature of notes per se. This graduate class required students to complete weekly readings and write notes. Students could decide their own pace of writing notes but were encouraged to do so along with weekly class schedule. Students were encouraged to focus on the highlights in the reading materials but not their own reflection or comments. Specific questions probed in this project are:

1. How weekly taught topics affect student's note-taking behavior?
2. What is the relation between type of class reading & note-taking?
3. How does time of submitting notes affect note sentiment & note length?

## [Social Networks Analysis: Do students want to work with their best friends?](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-analytics/blob/master/SNA/SNA_Working_with_Best_Friends%3F.pdf)

Project Description:        
Using social networks analysis(SNA) to understand the social dynamic for middle school students. As there seems to be a norm that we should never work with our best friend, I want to know if we can see that life wisdom reflected among middle school students. Specifically, my interested questions are as follows:

1. Is there a pattern when students choose who is their good friend in class?
2. Do students tend to work with their good friends in class?
3. Other findings such as students of highest popularity, isolated students,etc.

## [Learning Recommendation System: Create a personalized study path for students](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-analytics/blob/master/Recommendation-Sys/RecommendationSystem_Personalized_Learning_Path.pdf)

Project Description:        
Recommendation system is everywhere in our lives. Amazon, YouTube, Spotify, you name it. On the other hand, how can we use recommendation
system in education? As a learning recommendation system can become very complicated with algorithms and parameters, this project will demonstrate a simpler system that suggest a student’s learning path. By pooling data from students in the same class (like pooling preference from millions of YouTube viewers), this recommendation system can suggest a student which study unit to take and in their sequence. Some interesting to be explored are:

1. How does this learning recommendation system generate different paths for individual students?
2. Do those learning paths make sense from a pedagogical perspective? Especially regarding the arrangement of units and curriculum designs?
3. Will students really follow the suggested paths to study each unit?

## [Q-Matrix: Discovering knowledge & skills required in a test](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-analytics/blob/master/Q.Matrix/Qmatrix_Discovering_Skills_%26_Knowledge.pdf)

Project Description:        
Q-matrix in education is often used in test design and development. It is an important technique in psychometrics and useful to examine the validity of a test. To put it simply(in my own terms), I will say it is used to “see how many (and what) knowledge concepts our test is testing students, and how if we should revise the test design based on its error score ”. I explored its application by tinkering the following steps:

1. Create a Q-matrix to with self-defined knowledge concepts to measure the validity of a test design
2. Review the error score of the Q-matrix & suggest ways to revise the test

## [Decision Trees: Predict the college course dropouts](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-analytics/blob/master/Prediction/DecisonTrees_Predict_Student_Dropout.pdf)

Project Description:        
College course dropouts could be an administrative and a financial issue for universities. As there may be different reasons that students drop a course, it is useful to see what are the characteristics of the students and the nature of the course that are related to dropouts. In this project, I used 3 different decision tree models to predict college dropouts. Specifically, my interested
questions are as follows:

1. What are the important features about students that could lead to dropouts?
2. Which tree model works the best in this current case to predict student dropouts?
3. How to increase tree model performance to catch more true dropouts(true posive)?

## [K-means Clustering: Observe change in learning motivation & student grouping](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-analytics/blob/master/K-means%20clustering/KmeansClustering_EddieLin.pdf)

Project Description:        
K means is a commonly used technique in statistics and machine learning. It is an efficient way to clustering all data point in our dataset. It is unsupervised despite we have to assign (and try) cluster numbers to achieve an optimal
outcome. The logic of K means is to create different cluster of data points, where all data points in a particular cluster will be near each other and not the others in other clusters. In this project, I used K-means to analyzestudent motivation and students’ background. Major things to explore in this project include:

1. Use K-means to categorize students’ learning motivation
2. Use K means to group students in a class
