# data-anaytics

This repository stores several original data analytics/data science projects I've completed. The materials of the a project are store in the same folder. Feel free to use my dataset or code if you find them useful. Also, please let me know if you have feedback, comments, or questions(eddie.lin@tc.columbia.edu). The following are brief descriptions of each project and quick access to each project's write-up in the format of PDF or README.md.

## [Social Networks Analysis: Do students want to work with their best friends?](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-analytics/blob/master/SNA/SNA_Working_with_Best_Friends%3F.pdf)

Project Description:
Using social networks analysis(SNA) to understand the the social dynamic for middle school students. As there seems to be a norm that we should never work with our best friend, I want to know if we can see that life wisdom reflected among middle school students. Specifically, my interested questions are as follows:

1. Is there a pattern when students choose who is their good friend in class?
2. Do students tend to work with their good friends in class?
3. Other findings such as students of highest popularity, isolated students,etc.

## [Learning Recommendation System: Create a personalized study path for students](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-analytics/blob/master/Recommendation-Sys/RecommendationSystem_Personalized_Learning_Path.pdf)

Project Description:
Recommendation system is everywhere in our lives. Amazon, YouTube, Spotify, you name it. On the other hand, how can we use recommendation
system in education? As a learning recommendation system can become very complicated with algorithms and parameters, this project will demonstrate a simpler system that suggest a student’s learning path. By pooling data from students in the same class (like pooling preference from millions of YouTube viewers), this recommendation system can suggest a student which study unit to take and in their sequence. Some interesting to be explored are:

1. How does this learning recommendation system generate different paths for individual students?
2. Do those learning paths make sense from a pedagogical perspective? Especially regarding the arrangement of units and curriculum designs?
3. Will students really follow the suggested paths to study each unit?

## [Q-Matrix: Discovering knowledge & skills required in a test](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-analytics/blob/master/Q.Matrix/Qmatrix_Discovering_Skills_%26_Knowledge.pdf)

Project Description:
Q-matrix in education is often used in test design and development. It is an important technique in psychometrics and useful to examine the validity of a test. To put it simply(in my own terms), I will say it is used to “see how many (and what) knowledge concepts our test is testing students, and how if we should revise the test design based on its error score ”. I explored its application by tinkering the following steps:

1. Create a Q-matrix to with self-defined knowledge concepts to measure the validity of a test design
2. Review the error score of the Q-matrix & suggest ways to revise the test

## [Decision Trees: Predict the college course dropouts](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-analytics/blob/master/Prediction/DecisonTrees_Predict_Student_Dropout.pdf)

Project Description:
College course dropouts could be an administrative and a financial issue for universities. As there may be different reasons that students drop a course, it is useful to see what are the characteristics of the students and the nature of the course that are related to dropouts. In this project, I used 3 different decision tree models to predict college dropouts. Specifically, my interested
questions are as follows:

1. What are the important features about students that could lead to dropouts?
2. Which tree model works the best in this current case to predict student dropouts?
3. How to increase tree model performance to catch more true dropouts(true posive)?

## [K-means Clustering: Observe change in learning motivation & student grouping](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-analytics/blob/master/K-means%20clustering/KmeansClustering_EddieLin.pdf)

Project Description:
K means is a commonly used technique in statistics and machine learning. It is an efficient way to clustering all data point in our dataset. It is unsupervised despite we have to assign (and try) cluster numbers to achieve an optimal
outcome. The logic of K means is to create different cluster of data points, where all data points in a particular cluster will be near each other and not the others in other clusters. In this project, I used K-means to analyzestudent motivation and students’ background. Major things to explore in this project include:

1. Use K-means to categorize students’ learning motivation
2. Use K means to group students in a class
